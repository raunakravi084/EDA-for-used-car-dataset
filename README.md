# Used Car Price Prediction

## Overview

This project involves exploratory data analysis (EDA) for predicting the price of used cars. The dataset contains details of used cars sold on CarDekho.com in India, including various features that influence car prices. The goal is to analyze the data and derive insights that can help in building an effective machine learning model for price prediction.
